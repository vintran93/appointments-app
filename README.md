# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Requirements

- ✅ The code should be written in ES6 as much as possible
- ✅ Use the create-react-app generator to start your project.
- ✅ Follow the instructions on this repo to setup the generator: create-react-app (Links to an external site.)
- ✅ Your app should have one HTML page to render your react-redux application
- There should be 5 stateless components
- ✅ There should be 3 routes
- The Application must make use of react-router and proper RESTful routing (should you choose to use react-router v3 please refer to the appropriate docs (Links to an external site.); docs for v4 can be found here (Links to an external site.))
- Use Redux middleware to respond to and modify state change
- Make use of async actions and redux-thunk middleware to send data to and receive data from a server
- Your Rails API should handle the data persistence with a database. You should be using fetch() within your    actions to GET and POST data from your API - do not use jQuery methods.
- Your client-side application should handle the display of data with minimal data manipulation
- Your application should have some minimal styling: feel free to stick to a framework (like react-bootstrap),  but if you want to write (additional) CSS yourself, go for it!
